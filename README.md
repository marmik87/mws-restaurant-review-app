#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I incrementally converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### To run the Application
1. Clone/copy all files to your computer.
2. Run local server (`python -m http.server 8000` (if you do not have python installed, check the offical page for actual version Python's [website](https://www.python.org/)).
3. Open your favorite browser and visit `http://localhost:8000`.

### App dependencies
App is using [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
